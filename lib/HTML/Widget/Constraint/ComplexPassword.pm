=head1 NAME

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	my $widget = HTML::Widget->new('widget')->method('get')->action('/');
	
	...
	
	#constraints
	$widget->constraint(Length      => @columns)
		->min($HTML::Widget::Constraint::ComplexPassword::MIN_LENGTH)
		->message('Must be at least '.$HTML::Widget::Constraint::HP_Password::MIN_LENGTH.' characters long');
	$widget->constraint(HP_Password => @columns)
		->message(qq{
			Must contain at least $HTML::Widget::Constraint::HP_Password::MIN_LENGTH characters and include

			Special Character - "$HTML::Widget::Constraint::ComplexPassword::SPECIAL_CHARACTERS"
		)};

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A constraint for L<HTML::Widget> to check if the password is complex enought. Password must have
at least MIN_LENGTH characters count, one lower case character is required, one upper case character
is required and either number or one of SPECIAL_CHARACTERS is needed.

=head2 EXPORTS 

	our $MIN_LENGTH = 8;
	our $NUMBER_CHARACTERS  = '0123456789';
	our $SPECIAL_CHARACTERS = '~`!@#$%^&*()-_+={}[]\\|:;"\'<>,.?/';

=head2 TIPS

If you want to force different password lenght then do:

	use HTML::Widget::Constraint::ComplexPassword;
	$HTML::Widget::Constraint::HP_Password::MIN_LENGTH = 10;

If you want just numbers and no other special characters then remove characters from the
SPECIAL_CHARACTERS list:

	use HTML::Widget::Constraint::ComplexPassword;
	$HTML::Widget::Constraint::ComplexPassword::SPECIAL_CHARACTERS = '';

=head1 TODO

It will be nice to have more variants of "complexity". Let's say we can create
method ->level($level_type) that will switch between them. For me this default
is enought. If you have different demant just drop me an email and i can include it
here may be somebody else will reuse.
